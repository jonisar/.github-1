# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Bit

Bit is an extensible, **open-source** toolchain for building independent components, and composing them into high-performance and consistent modular and component-driven apps at speed.

It makes it easy to develop modular software projects from independently versioned components, connected through a dependency graph and which can be owned by numerous autonomous teams, collaborating together to deliver modern apps at speed, consistency and scale. It is a simple, modular and efficient way to build a single web application, while allowing to scale to any amount of teams collaborating together.
