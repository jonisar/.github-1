## We are **Team Bit**

Our mission is to help application builders advance from monoliths to composable software applications.  

We build the [open-source tools](https://bit.dev/) that help people build **anything in components** and the [cloud platform](https://bit.cloud/) that helps teams scale to many projects and teams with components.  

We build everything in components, open-source and cloud alike. You can find all our [components on Bit Cloud](https://bit.cloud/teambit) and see how we build on our cloud.
